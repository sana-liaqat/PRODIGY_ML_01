# Project Title: Linear Regression Model Implementation by Sana Liaqat

Description:
This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a linear regression model using a real-world dataset.

Project Overview:
Objective: To implement and evaluate a linear regression model.
Dataset: [Brief description of the dataset used, e.g., "A housing prices dataset."](If public, you can add a link to the dataset)
Tools and Technologies: Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Key Features:
1. Loading and preprocessing data from Google Drive using Google Colab
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Training a linear regression model
4. Making predictions and evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics
